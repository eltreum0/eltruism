For Retail:  
There are various outstanding bugs in Blizzard's UI, such as SetStatusBarTexture causing Statusbar values to be incorrectly set for a frame, Models not inheriting alpha and various others that can be found here <https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues>  
If you are using Light Mode and not Gradient, i recommend checking the new "NONE" texture option to prevent the blinking  
If you are using Light Mode and Gradient, i recommend enabling ElvUI Unitframe Textures instead of Gradient Textures  
Custom Textures in Light Mode will cause issues due to Blizzard bugs  
Aurabar Blinking is due to the SetStatusBarTexture issue mentioned, and can happen even without Eltruism enabled  
Nameplates Blinking is also due to the SetStatusBarTexture issue and happens if there is Texture replacing the existing Texture, this can happen to other nameplate addons like Plater and not just ElvUI Nameplates  
Objective Frame lost its mover in ElvUI but Eltruism has added it back, in order to get it to work you need to enter Edit Mode and move the Quest a bit, you can also change the Max Height there (used to be 550 in Eltruism), then reload. You will now be able to use the mover from ElvUI
